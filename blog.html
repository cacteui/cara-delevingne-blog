						<p>It is not a new thing that Cara is acting, but it certainly is a big thing that she happens to be in the new movie adaption of the John Green book called 'Paper Towns'.</p>
						<p>Now you are probably thinking, why do I have to know who wrote the book behind the movie that Cara is in, but I'm going to stop you right there. Because IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO JOHN GREEN IS AND WHAT HE WRITES I SUGGEST YOU GO READ HIS BOOK BEFORE WATCHING THE MOVIE.</p>
